A Walk In The Dark
==================

You try to survive in a dark and scary world to find a treasure. Run away from the monsters and especially try to avoid the big one. You can sprint by pressing shift. However, each time you sprint you lose stamina which regenerates slowly. If your stamina reaches zero, you will have to stand still for a few seconds.

If you turn out your light by pressing X, the ghosts will only see you when they're
really close. But without light you won't see a thing as well (and the boss will see
and hunt you anyway).

The tresure spawns after two minutes, together with the boss, who will hunt you down
restlessly. Find the treasure before he catches you.
