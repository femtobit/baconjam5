A Walk In The Dark
==================

You try to survive in a dark and scary world to find a treasure. Run away from the monsters and especially try to avoid the big one. You can sprint by pressing shift. However, each time you sprint you lose stamina which regenerates slowly. If your stamina reaches zero, you will have to stand still for a few seconds.
